## Introduction

This is a project to design to build out this 3-column preview card component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.
The objectives of this project was to:

- Make the users have a `optimal view` of the webpage depending on their devices.
- Make users see the `focus and hover states` of some important elements.

## Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- React

## What I learnt

- Actually learnt a lot about React especially how Components are named starting with a capital letter which took me by surprise,practising props/interfaces, how to use them to dynamically set the looks of a Component,and how to declare class names and the like in a React (.tsx) file.

- I also revised and learnt how to install React in other existing folders with ease.

(A little note: the Learn Note button is the Component I managed to do. It was fun to create it ngl,using the knowledge I got beforehand).
